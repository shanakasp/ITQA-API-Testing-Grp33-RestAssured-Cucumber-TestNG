    Given I am logged in as "<username>" with password "<password>" to update as "<userType>" Member1
    When I send a PUT request to "/api/books/<bookId>" with the following data Member1:
      | title              | author                |
      | <bookTitle>        | <bookAuthor>          |
    Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode> for put Member1
